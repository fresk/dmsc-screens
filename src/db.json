This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

All materials will be provided, and each student will be given a written guide with photos, tips and resources to take home with them.\n\nWe will discuss all of the tools necessary to begin, such as round nose pliers, and wire cutters, etc. We will also discuss different materials and their uses, such as jump rings, lobster clasps, crimp beads, bead wire, and more. This is a hands on course, so we will be learning techniques as we create!\n\nThe goals of this class are to cover the basics and have each student complete 3 different pieces of jewelry to take home: a pair of drop earrings, a pendant chain necklace, and one chunky beaded statement necklace. Each student is encouraged to get as creative as they like, but we will also have a few examples to duplicate if a jump start is needed.\n\nThis fun and relaxed class is great to take with a group of friends, and lots of discussion and chatting are encouraged while we work!

We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

His film directing includes four short pieces and the features <i>The Yoofo Club</i> and <i>Haunting Villisca</i> (the latter having been named Best Feature at the Iowa Independent Film Festival.)\n\nAs an actor, James has worked extensively in theatre, film, commercials, and industrials around the Midwest, including Chicago, Indianapolis and Des Moines. Favorite roles include de Stogumber in <i>St. Joan</i> at Chicago’s Bailiwick Repertory, Teach in <i>American Buffalo</i>, Goldberg in <i>The Birthday Party</i> and Eddie in <i>Fool for Love</i>. He appears in the pilot episode of Bluebox Limited’s medical thriller, <i>Spread</i>, for MTV, as well as in their short film, <i>Impulse</i>. Other film appearances include <i>The Final Season, Dead Awake, Sixteen to Life, Ash</i> and, most recently, <i>The Night Visitor</i>.\n\nJames was selected to assist with teaching acting while a student at Iowa State University; shortly thereafter, he spent a semester at ISU as a guest instructor.  A devoted student and teacher of the principles and methods espoused by Sanford Meisner, James has continued to study and teach acting alongside his own professional acting career, as both an independent instructor and as a faculty member at several academic and other institutions (including Indiana University, where he achieved his MFA in Acting, and Valparaiso University, where he was an assistant professor.)\n\n<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: </b>  We have accepted students down to the age of 12 into the class, but this is more the exception than the rule.  Some of the scenes we use contain adult language and themes and, while we allow students to \"switch out\" language they're uncomfortable with, we don't condone it since that's not how it works \"in the real world\" (where you're expected to do the script as written.)  Even if some students switch out language, others don't, so there's a likelihood that strong language will be heard (even if you're not the one saying it.)  If this is too great a difficulty for you, we certainly understand, but the class is not for you.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Contact education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

Are you OK with getting your hands dirty? This 10 week class will introduce you to basic drawing concepts and techniques with a focus on the use of charcoals and related mediums. Taught by local artist, Robert Reeves, you will learn to draw from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. Open to all experience levels.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

His film directing includes four short pieces and the features <i>The Yoofo Club</i> and <i>Haunting Villisca</i> (the latter having been named Best Feature at the Iowa Independent Film Festival.)\n\nAs an actor, James has worked extensively in theatre, film, commercials, and industrials around the Midwest, including Chicago, Indianapolis and Des Moines. Favorite roles include de Stogumber in <i>St. Joan</i> at Chicago’s Bailiwick Repertory, Teach in <i>American Buffalo</i>, Goldberg in <i>The Birthday Party</i> and Eddie in <i>Fool for Love</i>. He appears in the pilot episode of Bluebox Limited’s medical thriller, <i>Spread</i>, for MTV, as well as in their short film, <i>Impulse</i>. Other film appearances include <i>The Final Season, Dead Awake, Sixteen to Life, Ash</i> and, most recently, <i>The Night Visitor</i>.\n\nJames was selected to assist with teaching acting while a student at Iowa State University; shortly thereafter, he spent a semester at ISU as a guest instructor.  A devoted student and teacher of the principles and methods espoused by Sanford Meisner, James has continued to study and teach acting alongside his own professional acting career, as both an independent instructor and as a faculty member at several academic and other institutions (including Indiana University, where he achieved his MFA in Acting, and Valparaiso University, where he was an assistant professor.)\n\n<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: </b>  We have accepted students down to the age of 12 into the class, but this is more the exception than the rule.  Some of the scenes we use contain adult language and themes and, while we allow students to \"switch out\" language they're uncomfortable with, we don't condone it since that's not how it works \"in the real world\" (where you're expected to do the script as written.)  Even if some students switch out language, others don't, so there's a likelihood that strong language will be heard (even if you're not the one saying it.)  If this is too great a difficulty for you, we certainly understand, but the class is not for you.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Contact education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

Are you OK with getting your hands dirty? This 10 week class will introduce you to basic drawing concepts and techniques with a focus on the use of charcoals and related mediums. Taught by local artist, Robert Reeves, you will learn to draw from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. Open to all experience levels.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

Every month we present a rehearsed reading of a great play—either brand new, an obscure old find, or something new to Des Moines.\n\nPage2Stage: “Friendly Fire” by Sean Demers\n\nThe Third Monday in January: Jan. 20 at 7 p.m. FREE\nJava Joe's 4th Street Theatre\n\nJoin us in January for a brand new script by a playwright currently in the University of Iowa's Playwright's Workshop. \"Friendly Fire\" is the story of David and Walter, two men whose job it is to guard a woman tied to a bed. They are not sure as to the reason for this job except that it involves bitter secrecy. The action takes place in a hotel room which is visited upon by a woman named Irene who is by turns maid, nurse, and accomplice. Irene shares secrets with both Walter and David.\n\nDue to the serene nature of the job, David kills time by talking about seemingly inane b.s. to irritate or perhaps provoke Walter. As he spans the conversation from politics to patriotism to philosophy, Walter tries to take it all in stride, while he plots his own strategies.\n\n\"Friendly Fire\" explores the nature and meaning of justice. The piece is inspired by our country’s struggle with the propriety of torture under the tenure of our 43rd president. The play also examines our fascination with captivity as well as our willingness to acquiesce to blind obedience.\n\nCast:\nDavid: Brandon Brockshus\nWalter: Jim Morrill\nIrene: Marnie Strate\n\nDirected by Elizabeth Riordan",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

His film directing includes four short pieces and the features <i>The Yoofo Club</i> and <i>Haunting Villisca</i> (the latter having been named Best Feature at the Iowa Independent Film Festival.)\n\nAs an actor, James has worked extensively in theatre, film, commercials, and industrials around the Midwest, including Chicago, Indianapolis and Des Moines. Favorite roles include de Stogumber in <i>St. Joan</i> at Chicago’s Bailiwick Repertory, Teach in <i>American Buffalo</i>, Goldberg in <i>The Birthday Party</i> and Eddie in <i>Fool for Love</i>. He appears in the pilot episode of Bluebox Limited’s medical thriller, <i>Spread</i>, for MTV, as well as in their short film, <i>Impulse</i>. Other film appearances include <i>The Final Season, Dead Awake, Sixteen to Life, Ash</i> and, most recently, <i>The Night Visitor</i>.\n\nJames was selected to assist with teaching acting while a student at Iowa State University; shortly thereafter, he spent a semester at ISU as a guest instructor.  A devoted student and teacher of the principles and methods espoused by Sanford Meisner, James has continued to study and teach acting alongside his own professional acting career, as both an independent instructor and as a faculty member at several academic and other institutions (including Indiana University, where he achieved his MFA in Acting, and Valparaiso University, where he was an assistant professor.)\n\n<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: </b>  We have accepted students down to the age of 12 into the class, but this is more the exception than the rule.  Some of the scenes we use contain adult language and themes and, while we allow students to \"switch out\" language they're uncomfortable with, we don't condone it since that's not how it works \"in the real world\" (where you're expected to do the script as written.)  Even if some students switch out language, others don't, so there's a likelihood that strong language will be heard (even if you're not the one saying it.)  If this is too great a difficulty for you, we certainly understand, but the class is not for you.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Contact education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

Are you OK with getting your hands dirty? This 10 week class will introduce you to basic drawing concepts and techniques with a focus on the use of charcoals and related mediums. Taught by local artist, Robert Reeves, you will learn to draw from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. Open to all experience levels.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

His film directing includes four short pieces and the features <i>The Yoofo Club</i> and <i>Haunting Villisca</i> (the latter having been named Best Feature at the Iowa Independent Film Festival.)\n\nAs an actor, James has worked extensively in theatre, film, commercials, and industrials around the Midwest, including Chicago, Indianapolis and Des Moines. Favorite roles include de Stogumber in <i>St. Joan</i> at Chicago’s Bailiwick Repertory, Teach in <i>American Buffalo</i>, Goldberg in <i>The Birthday Party</i> and Eddie in <i>Fool for Love</i>. He appears in the pilot episode of Bluebox Limited’s medical thriller, <i>Spread</i>, for MTV, as well as in their short film, <i>Impulse</i>. Other film appearances include <i>The Final Season, Dead Awake, Sixteen to Life, Ash</i> and, most recently, <i>The Night Visitor</i>.\n\nJames was selected to assist with teaching acting while a student at Iowa State University; shortly thereafter, he spent a semester at ISU as a guest instructor.  A devoted student and teacher of the principles and methods espoused by Sanford Meisner, James has continued to study and teach acting alongside his own professional acting career, as both an independent instructor and as a faculty member at several academic and other institutions (including Indiana University, where he achieved his MFA in Acting, and Valparaiso University, where he was an assistant professor.)\n\n<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: </b>  We have accepted students down to the age of 12 into the class, but this is more the exception than the rule.  Some of the scenes we use contain adult language and themes and, while we allow students to \"switch out\" language they're uncomfortable with, we don't condone it since that's not how it works \"in the real world\" (where you're expected to do the script as written.)  Even if some students switch out language, others don't, so there's a likelihood that strong language will be heard (even if you're not the one saying it.)  If this is too great a difficulty for you, we certainly understand, but the class is not for you.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Contact education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

Are you OK with getting your hands dirty? This 10 week class will introduce you to basic drawing concepts and techniques with a focus on the use of charcoals and related mediums. Taught by local artist, Robert Reeves, you will learn to draw from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. Open to all experience levels.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

His film directing includes four short pieces and the features <i>The Yoofo Club</i> and <i>Haunting Villisca</i> (the latter having been named Best Feature at the Iowa Independent Film Festival.)\n\nAs an actor, James has worked extensively in theatre, film, commercials, and industrials around the Midwest, including Chicago, Indianapolis and Des Moines. Favorite roles include de Stogumber in <i>St. Joan</i> at Chicago’s Bailiwick Repertory, Teach in <i>American Buffalo</i>, Goldberg in <i>The Birthday Party</i> and Eddie in <i>Fool for Love</i>. He appears in the pilot episode of Bluebox Limited’s medical thriller, <i>Spread</i>, for MTV, as well as in their short film, <i>Impulse</i>. Other film appearances include <i>The Final Season, Dead Awake, Sixteen to Life, Ash</i> and, most recently, <i>The Night Visitor</i>.\n\nJames was selected to assist with teaching acting while a student at Iowa State University; shortly thereafter, he spent a semester at ISU as a guest instructor.  A devoted student and teacher of the principles and methods espoused by Sanford Meisner, James has continued to study and teach acting alongside his own professional acting career, as both an independent instructor and as a faculty member at several academic and other institutions (including Indiana University, where he achieved his MFA in Acting, and Valparaiso University, where he was an assistant professor.)\n\n<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: </b>  We have accepted students down to the age of 12 into the class, but this is more the exception than the rule.  Some of the scenes we use contain adult language and themes and, while we allow students to \"switch out\" language they're uncomfortable with, we don't condone it since that's not how it works \"in the real world\" (where you're expected to do the script as written.)  Even if some students switch out language, others don't, so there's a likelihood that strong language will be heard (even if you're not the one saying it.)  If this is too great a difficulty for you, we certainly understand, but the class is not for you.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Contact education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

Are you OK with getting your hands dirty? This 10 week class will introduce you to basic drawing concepts and techniques with a focus on the use of charcoals and related mediums. Taught by local artist, Robert Reeves, you will learn to draw from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. Open to all experience levels.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

His film directing includes four short pieces and the features <i>The Yoofo Club</i> and <i>Haunting Villisca</i> (the latter having been named Best Feature at the Iowa Independent Film Festival.)\n\nAs an actor, James has worked extensively in theatre, film, commercials, and industrials around the Midwest, including Chicago, Indianapolis and Des Moines. Favorite roles include de Stogumber in <i>St. Joan</i> at Chicago’s Bailiwick Repertory, Teach in <i>American Buffalo</i>, Goldberg in <i>The Birthday Party</i> and Eddie in <i>Fool for Love</i>. He appears in the pilot episode of Bluebox Limited’s medical thriller, <i>Spread</i>, for MTV, as well as in their short film, <i>Impulse</i>. Other film appearances include <i>The Final Season, Dead Awake, Sixteen to Life, Ash</i> and, most recently, <i>The Night Visitor</i>.\n\nJames was selected to assist with teaching acting while a student at Iowa State University; shortly thereafter, he spent a semester at ISU as a guest instructor.  A devoted student and teacher of the principles and methods espoused by Sanford Meisner, James has continued to study and teach acting alongside his own professional acting career, as both an independent instructor and as a faculty member at several academic and other institutions (including Indiana University, where he achieved his MFA in Acting, and Valparaiso University, where he was an assistant professor.)\n\n<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: </b>  We have accepted students down to the age of 12 into the class, but this is more the exception than the rule.  Some of the scenes we use contain adult language and themes and, while we allow students to \"switch out\" language they're uncomfortable with, we don't condone it since that's not how it works \"in the real world\" (where you're expected to do the script as written.)  Even if some students switch out language, others don't, so there's a likelihood that strong language will be heard (even if you're not the one saying it.)  If this is too great a difficulty for you, we certainly understand, but the class is not for you.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Contact education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

Are you OK with getting your hands dirty? This 10 week class will introduce you to basic drawing concepts and techniques with a focus on the use of charcoals and related mediums. Taught by local artist, Robert Reeves, you will learn to draw from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. Open to all experience levels.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

Every month we present a rehearsed reading of a great play—either brand new, an obscure old find, or something new to Des Moines.\n\nPage2Stage: “Friendly Fire” by Sean Demers\n\nThe Third Monday in January: Jan. 20 at 7 p.m. FREE\nJava Joe's 4th Street Theatre\n\nJoin us in January for a brand new script by a playwright currently in the University of Iowa's Playwright's Workshop. \"Friendly Fire\" is the story of David and Walter, two men whose job it is to guard a woman tied to a bed. They are not sure as to the reason for this job except that it involves bitter secrecy. The action takes place in a hotel room which is visited upon by a woman named Irene who is by turns maid, nurse, and accomplice. Irene shares secrets with both Walter and David.\n\nDue to the serene nature of the job, David kills time by talking about seemingly inane b.s. to irritate or perhaps provoke Walter. As he spans the conversation from politics to patriotism to philosophy, Walter tries to take it all in stride, while he plots his own strategies.\n\n\"Friendly Fire\" explores the nature and meaning of justice. The piece is inspired by our country’s struggle with the propriety of torture under the tenure of our 43rd president. The play also examines our fascination with captivity as well as our willingness to acquiesce to blind obedience.\n\nCast:\nDavid: Brandon Brockshus\nWalter: Jim Morrill\nIrene: Marnie Strate\n\nDirected by Elizabeth Riordan",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

His film directing includes four short pieces and the features <i>The Yoofo Club</i> and <i>Haunting Villisca</i> (the latter having been named Best Feature at the Iowa Independent Film Festival.)\n\nAs an actor, James has worked extensively in theatre, film, commercials, and industrials around the Midwest, including Chicago, Indianapolis and Des Moines. Favorite roles include de Stogumber in <i>St. Joan</i> at Chicago’s Bailiwick Repertory, Teach in <i>American Buffalo</i>, Goldberg in <i>The Birthday Party</i> and Eddie in <i>Fool for Love</i>. He appears in the pilot episode of Bluebox Limited’s medical thriller, <i>Spread</i>, for MTV, as well as in their short film, <i>Impulse</i>. Other film appearances include <i>The Final Season, Dead Awake, Sixteen to Life, Ash</i> and, most recently, <i>The Night Visitor</i>.\n\nJames was selected to assist with teaching acting while a student at Iowa State University; shortly thereafter, he spent a semester at ISU as a guest instructor.  A devoted student and teacher of the principles and methods espoused by Sanford Meisner, James has continued to study and teach acting alongside his own professional acting career, as both an independent instructor and as a faculty member at several academic and other institutions (including Indiana University, where he achieved his MFA in Acting, and Valparaiso University, where he was an assistant professor.)\n\n<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: </b>  We have accepted students down to the age of 12 into the class, but this is more the exception than the rule.  Some of the scenes we use contain adult language and themes and, while we allow students to \"switch out\" language they're uncomfortable with, we don't condone it since that's not how it works \"in the real world\" (where you're expected to do the script as written.)  Even if some students switch out language, others don't, so there's a likelihood that strong language will be heard (even if you're not the one saying it.)  If this is too great a difficulty for you, we certainly understand, but the class is not for you.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Contact education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

Are you OK with getting your hands dirty? This 10 week class will introduce you to basic drawing concepts and techniques with a focus on the use of charcoals and related mediums. Taught by local artist, Robert Reeves, you will learn to draw from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. Open to all experience levels.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

His film directing includes four short pieces and the features <i>The Yoofo Club</i> and <i>Haunting Villisca</i> (the latter having been named Best Feature at the Iowa Independent Film Festival.)\n\nAs an actor, James has worked extensively in theatre, film, commercials, and industrials around the Midwest, including Chicago, Indianapolis and Des Moines. Favorite roles include de Stogumber in <i>St. Joan</i> at Chicago’s Bailiwick Repertory, Teach in <i>American Buffalo</i>, Goldberg in <i>The Birthday Party</i> and Eddie in <i>Fool for Love</i>. He appears in the pilot episode of Bluebox Limited’s medical thriller, <i>Spread</i>, for MTV, as well as in their short film, <i>Impulse</i>. Other film appearances include <i>The Final Season, Dead Awake, Sixteen to Life, Ash</i> and, most recently, <i>The Night Visitor</i>.\n\nJames was selected to assist with teaching acting while a student at Iowa State University; shortly thereafter, he spent a semester at ISU as a guest instructor.  A devoted student and teacher of the principles and methods espoused by Sanford Meisner, James has continued to study and teach acting alongside his own professional acting career, as both an independent instructor and as a faculty member at several academic and other institutions (including Indiana University, where he achieved his MFA in Acting, and Valparaiso University, where he was an assistant professor.)\n\n<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: </b>  We have accepted students down to the age of 12 into the class, but this is more the exception than the rule.  Some of the scenes we use contain adult language and themes and, while we allow students to \"switch out\" language they're uncomfortable with, we don't condone it since that's not how it works \"in the real world\" (where you're expected to do the script as written.)  Even if some students switch out language, others don't, so there's a likelihood that strong language will be heard (even if you're not the one saying it.)  If this is too great a difficulty for you, we certainly understand, but the class is not for you.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Contact education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

Are you OK with getting your hands dirty? This 10 week class will introduce you to basic drawing concepts and techniques with a focus on the use of charcoals and related mediums. Taught by local artist, Robert Reeves, you will learn to draw from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. Open to all experience levels.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

Are you OK with getting your hands dirty? This 10 week class will introduce you to basic drawing concepts and techniques with a focus on the use of charcoals and related mediums. Taught by local artist, Robert Reeves, you will learn to draw from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. Open to all experience levels.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

Are you OK with getting your hands dirty? This 10 week class will introduce you to basic drawing concepts and techniques with a focus on the use of charcoals and related mediums. Taught by local artist, Robert Reeves, you will learn to draw from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. Open to all experience levels.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

Are you OK with getting your hands dirty? This 10 week class will introduce you to basic drawing concepts and techniques with a focus on the use of charcoals and related mediums. Taught by local artist, Robert Reeves, you will learn to draw from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. Open to all experience levels.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

Peter Brook and his collaborators have crafted a concentrated night of theatre that focuses on the fatal relationships between the gypsy, soldier, village girl and bullfighter. The score retains all of the most famous musical moments of the original: Carmen’s Habanera and Seguidilla, Don Jose’s Flower Song, and Escamillo’s swaggering Toreador Song. Performed at the Des Moines Social Club’s newly remodeled facility, this will be an opera experience not-to-be missed.\n\nShowtimes:\nJuly 10, 2014,  7:00pm &amp; 9:00pm\nJuly 19, 2014, 1:00pm\n\nBuy tickets <a href=\"https://etm.patrontechnology.com/o/DMMO/p/run_module.php?__module__=3625\">here</a>.",

Every month we present a rehearsed reading of a great play—either brand new, an obscure old find, or something new to Des Moines.\n\nPage2Stage: “Friendly Fire” by Sean Demers\n\nThe Third Monday in January: Jan. 20 at 7 p.m. FREE\nJava Joe's 4th Street Theatre\n\nJoin us in January for a brand new script by a playwright currently in the University of Iowa's Playwright's Workshop. \"Friendly Fire\" is the story of David and Walter, two men whose job it is to guard a woman tied to a bed. They are not sure as to the reason for this job except that it involves bitter secrecy. The action takes place in a hotel room which is visited upon by a woman named Irene who is by turns maid, nurse, and accomplice. Irene shares secrets with both Walter and David.\n\nDue to the serene nature of the job, David kills time by talking about seemingly inane b.s. to irritate or perhaps provoke Walter. As he spans the conversation from politics to patriotism to philosophy, Walter tries to take it all in stride, while he plots his own strategies.\n\n\"Friendly Fire\" explores the nature and meaning of justice. The piece is inspired by our country’s struggle with the propriety of torture under the tenure of our 43rd president. The play also examines our fascination with captivity as well as our willingness to acquiesce to blind obedience.\n\nCast:\nDavid: Brandon Brockshus\nWalter: Jim Morrill\nIrene: Marnie Strate\n\nDirected by Elizabeth Riordan",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

The class will cover a wide variety of topics including materials, color theory, brush techniques, and composition. Learn to paint from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. All skill levels are welcome.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\nRobert currently works and lives a very full life in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org <b></b>",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

The class will cover a wide variety of topics including materials, color theory, brush techniques, and composition. Learn to paint from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. All skill levels are welcome.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\nRobert currently works and lives a very full life in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org <b></b>",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org",

This class is appropriate for any ages (18-118), all sizes and fitness levels.  No prior dance experience is needed and no, you are not required to show your belly.  All you need is a willingness to learn, meet great people, and to have a lot of fun.  We will have you dancing in your very first class.\n\n<strong>Instructor Bio:  </strong>Dawn Grey is an American Tribal Style® Belly Dancer, Certified Instructor, Fat Chance Belly Dance® Sister Studio, and the Director of Blissful Sunrise Belly Dance. She has had a love of dance almost since before she could walk.  She has been trained in ballet, tap, and jazz dance throughout her childhood, teens, and as a dance major in college.  Then life stepped in.  She is a devoted wife and mother of two who stopped dancing to get a job with health insurance.  Fourteen years later she realized something was missing.  It was then that she found ATS® Belly Dance and fell in love.  She has not stopped since and loves to share her passion with others.\n\n<strong>FAQ’s:</strong>\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Am I too old, large, out of shape, etc., etc. for belly dance?\n<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not.  This dance is appropriate for all.  I have had students of all shapes and sizes and students in their twenties as well as students in their seventies.  If you have thought about it and then talked yourself out of it for any reason, now is your chance to give it a whirl in a fun and supportive environment.  If you have health concerns, we ask that your consult your physician before participating in any physical activity, but generally we can make modifications to suit your needs.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What should I wear/bring to class?\n<strong>A:</strong> You should wear something comfortable that you can move in.  Generally yoga pants or sweats with a tank top or snug fitting T-shirt are fine.  If you like you can wear a long flowing skirt. We usually dance barefoot, but if you need or want shoes, you will need some that do not have too much traction (dance shoes are good) and have not been worn outside in order to protect the integrity of the dance floor. Bring a water bottle for hydration and by week 3 you will need a set of zills (finger cymbals).  We will talk about this more on the first day of class.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to dance in front of other people?\n<strong>A:</strong> Well, there most likely will be other students, and of course, the instructor in your class; however, other than that, no.  There will be performance opportunities available for students who want to go that route, but you never have to perform if you do not want to.  Some people are content to just come to class once a week, have a great time, dance off some stress, and then get on with the rest of their lives.  That is perfectly ok.\n\n<strong>Questions?</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:info@desmoinessocialclub.org\">info@desmoinessocialclub.org</a>",

The class will cover a wide variety of topics including materials, color theory, brush techniques, and composition. Learn to paint from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. All skill levels are welcome.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\nRobert currently works and lives a very full life in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org <b></b>",

Every month we present a rehearsed reading of a great play—either brand new, an obscure old find, or something new to Des Moines.\n\nPage2Stage: “Friendly Fire” by Sean Demers\n\nThe Third Monday in January: Jan. 20 at 7 p.m. FREE\nJava Joe's 4th Street Theatre\n\nJoin us in January for a brand new script by a playwright currently in the University of Iowa's Playwright's Workshop. \"Friendly Fire\" is the story of David and Walter, two men whose job it is to guard a woman tied to a bed. They are not sure as to the reason for this job except that it involves bitter secrecy. The action takes place in a hotel room which is visited upon by a woman named Irene who is by turns maid, nurse, and accomplice. Irene shares secrets with both Walter and David.\n\nDue to the serene nature of the job, David kills time by talking about seemingly inane b.s. to irritate or perhaps provoke Walter. As he spans the conversation from politics to patriotism to philosophy, Walter tries to take it all in stride, while he plots his own strategies.\n\n\"Friendly Fire\" explores the nature and meaning of justice. The piece is inspired by our country’s struggle with the propriety of torture under the tenure of our 43rd president. The play also examines our fascination with captivity as well as our willingness to acquiesce to blind obedience.\n\nCast:\nDavid: Brandon Brockshus\nWalter: Jim Morrill\nIrene: Marnie Strate\n\nDirected by Elizabeth Riordan",

The purpose of this class is to get a great workout AND lose yourself in the rhythm.  It's not just exercise...it fills your soul!  You can tone and shape, build your cardiovascular endurance, and lose weight all while picking up some new dance moves! We consider our dance style more street dance and do not follow traditional dance standards or techniques. For that reason, students do not need to have a dance background, just determination and commitment to progress in a Dance Trance class. The more classes you attend the quicker you’ll learn the choreography!  You won't find another class where you have more fun while you're working out!  This class is for people who LOVE to dance.  More information at https://www.facebook.com/dancetrancedesmoines?ref=hl and\n\nhttp://dancetrancefitness.com/desmoines/\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Jamie Shae is a mother of two, a native Iowan and an artist at heart.  As Jamie continued to seek ways to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit, she came across Dance Trance Fitness and knew instantly this was something special.  Jamie has always been an athlete - everything from gymnastics, dance, softball, to kickboxing - but she never really loved working out until she found Dance Trance Fitness.  Now she wants to share her newfound love with others to create a community of men and women supporting each other, both on and off the dance floor.\n\n<b>Ages: </b>Recommended for 16 and up.  Some music contains explicit lyrics.<b></b>\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org\n\n&nbsp;",

The class will cover a wide variety of topics including materials, color theory, brush techniques, and composition. Learn to paint from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. All skill levels are welcome.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\nRobert currently works and lives a very full life in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org <b></b>",

The class will cover a wide variety of topics including materials, color theory, brush techniques, and composition. Learn to paint from observation using simple objects, complex still life arrangements, and live models. All skill levels are welcome.\n\n<b>Instructor Bio:</b>  Robert Reeves was born in 1970 to a desperate runaway who sold him to gypsies who in turn traded him for a bag of seed corn, some magic beans, and a carton of Kools to a lovely couple from Waterloo, Iowa who raised him as their own.  He thus began his life in much the same way he was destined to live it: going several directions at once.  He received a BA in Art from the University of Northern Iowa in 1994 all while pursuing interests in film, theater, and music.  He has been creating and exhibiting Art for over 18 years. Working primarily from photos taken while chronicling his time spent walking and traveling Reeves draws and paints moments of personal significance and striking balance.  His painting style employs rough, energetic handling of the medium, deep contrasts, and highly saturated colors.  Scenes that appear to be photographic from a distance dissolve into masses of fervent brush strokes and splotches of paint. Building facades become washes. Figures become a slash of brush.  While the finished works appear to be plausibly genuine his process for arriving at the final composition is more organic: shifting figures and structures around to match the memory of the moment rather than remain fully within the constrains of reproduction. He seeks to move beyond the source and delve into his memory and emotions from the moment and bring it to the viewer.\n\nRobert currently works and lives a very full life in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n<b>Questions? </b>Email education@desmoinessocialclub.org <b></b>",

      "content": "Page2Stage is the Des Moines Social Club’s monthly play reading series. Start time, and venue: 6 p.m. at Java Joe’s 4th Street Theatre. Regularly on the third Monday of the month. Every month we present a rehearsed reading of a great play—either brand new, an obscure old find, or something new to Des Moines.\n\nPage2Stage: “Friendly Fire” by Sean Demers\n\nThe Third Monday in January: Jan. 20 at 7 p.m. FREE\nJava Joe's 4th Street Theatre\n\nJoin us in January for a brand new script by a playwright currently in the University of Iowa's Playwright's Workshop. \"Friendly Fire\" is the story of David and Walter, two men whose job it is to guard a woman tied to a bed. They are not sure as to the reason for this job except that it involves bitter secrecy. The action takes place in a hotel room which is visited upon by a woman named Irene who is by turns maid, nurse, and accomplice. Irene shares secrets with both Walter and David.\n\nDue to the serene nature of the job, David kills time by talking about seemingly inane b.s. to irritate or perhaps provoke Walter. As he spans the conversation from politics to patriotism to philosophy, Walter tries to take it all in stride, while he plots his own strategies.\n\n\"Friendly Fire\" explores the nature and meaning of justice. The piece is inspired by our country’s struggle with the propriety of torture under the tenure of our 43rd president. The play also examines our fascination with captivity as well as our willingness to acquiesce to blind obedience.\n\nCast:\nDavid: Brandon Brockshus\nWalter: Jim Morrill\nIrene: Marnie Strate\n\nDirected by Elizabeth Riordan",

They are not sure as to the reason for this job except that it involves bitter secrecy. The action takes place in a hotel room which is visited upon by a woman named Irene who is by turns maid, nurse, and accomplice. Irene shares secrets with both Walter and David.\n\nDue to the serene nature of the job, David kills time by talking about seemingly inane b.s. to irritate or perhaps provoke Walter. As he spans the conversation from politics to patriotism to philosophy, Walter tries to take it all in stride, while he plots his own strategies.\n\n\"Friendly Fire\" explores the nature and meaning of justice. The piece is inspired by our country’s struggle with the propriety of torture under the tenure of our 43rd president. The play also examines our fascination with captivity as well as our willingness to acquiesce to blind obedience.\n\nCast:\nDavid: Brandon Brockshus\nWalter: Jim Morrill\nIrene: Marnie Strate\n\nDirected by Elizabeth Riordan",

They are not sure as to the reason for this job except that it involves bitter secrecy. The action takes place in a hotel room which is visited upon by a woman named Irene who is by turns maid, nurse, and accomplice. Irene shares secrets with both Walter and David.\n\nDue to the serene nature of the job, David kills time by talking about seemingly inane b.s. to irritate or perhaps provoke Walter. As he spans the conversation from politics to patriotism to philosophy, Walter tries to take it all in stride, while he plots his own strategies.\n\n\"Friendly Fire\" explores the nature and meaning of justice. The piece is inspired by our country’s struggle with the propriety of torture under the tenure of our 43rd president. The play also examines our fascination with captivity as well as our willingness to acquiesce to blind obedience.\n\nCast:\nDavid: Brandon Brockshus\nWalter: Jim Morrill\nIrene: Marnie Strate\n\nDirected by Elizabeth Riordan",

Every month we present a rehearsed reading of a great play—either brand new, an obscure old find, or something new to Des Moines.\n\nPage2Stage: “Friendly Fire” by Sean Demers\n\nThe Third Monday in January: Jan. 20 at 7 p.m. FREE\nJava Joe's 4th Street Theatre\n\nJoin us in January for a brand new script by a playwright currently in the University of Iowa's Playwright's Workshop. \"Friendly Fire\" is the story of David and Walter, two men whose job it is to guard a woman tied to a bed. They are not sure as to the reason for this job except that it involves bitter secrecy. The action takes place in a hotel room which is visited upon by a woman named Irene who is by turns maid, nurse, and accomplice. Irene shares secrets with both Walter and David.\n\nDue to the serene nature of the job, David kills time by talking about seemingly inane b.s. to irritate or perhaps provoke Walter.

After a successful three year run the night will be reborn as MODERN LOVE. This dance party and social gathering will expand upon the funky soulful musical foundation of Pressure Drop to include a vast array of new sounds. Music without borders. Strictly Vinyl. Strictly Positive vibrations. No Cover. No Closed minds. Second Saturdays.\r\n\r\nTuesday Team Trivia: One of Des Moines’ longest running Trivia nights, this weekly Tuesday night event features 8 rounds of trivia questions written by the hosts themselves, covering a wide range of topics, from pro wrestling to Nickelodeon characters to current events and everything in between. Bring a team of 2 – 6 or show up to join a team; Each weekly winner gets to pick the first category for the next week’s trivia and gets some well-deserved bragging rights. Monthly winners receive a reserved table the next month, and whatever else we might come up with. Door prizes given away throughout the night.\r\n\r\nDes Moines Poetry Slam: Currently in its twelfth year of existence, we are excited to welcome the Des Moines Poetry Slam to its new home at the Firehouse. This event is an amateur, literary competition where poets read or recite original material that is then judged on a numeric scale by previously selected judges from the audience. Poetry Slam is an entertaining, high energy art form that incorporates elements of writing as well as public speaking. Often deemed the People’s art, a Poetry Slam differs from an open mic in that the sense of competition creates a crowd pleasing mixture of art and theater, think of a gentler version of Evening at the Improv. The Des Moines Poetry Slam is currently seeking to host the National Poetry Slam in 2016.\r\n\r\nSocial Club Sessions: Don’t think we’ll sit quiet when our recurring events aren’t occupying the bar. With options for both early and late shows, join us as we harken back to our Sideshow Lounge roots with an eclectic variety of local, national, and international music.\r\n\r\nRex Manning Day: Rex Manning Day is a night dedicated to all the things you loved / hoped you’d forget about the ’90s. Featuring local bands playing 90′s only cover sets followed by a dance party with DJ NICE KICKS, the only strictly 90′s hip hop / r&amp;b DJ this side of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nRamona Joyce’s American Voices: Ramona Joyce’s American Voices is a monthly interview of a game show featuring hometown legends and mysteries. Part performance, part interview, but mostly part shenanigans.\r\n\r\nRevolver Comedy Revue: Anything Improv and the Des Moines Social Club present a high caliber comedy show featuring a rotation of Des Moines best stand-up and improv comedians performing an eclectic evening for fans of all types of comedy.\r\n\r\nCall and Response: A Variety Show – Hosted by influential Iowa musician Patrick Tape Fleming (Poison Control Center, Gloom Balloon, BiFi Records), Call and Response features intimate in depth one-on-one conversations between musician and musician. They’ll not only talk back and forth with Fleming but perform songs together that have influenced both artists. Guests will also go deep into their own heart and soul about the creation of their music and perform.\r\n\r\nHaiku Deathmatch: A once a month, all-bets-off poetry slam with a revolving theme. The inagural late night poetry slam will be a Haiku Deathmatch, a fast paced, team oriented poetry competition; think of mashing a poetry reading with The Voice and you won’t be far off. The Deathmatch is an invite-only competition, readers are notable talents of the community and the judges are recognized writers, educators and entertainers. Judges are encouraged to award points based on personal opinion and not academic knowledge, making their personality an intrinsic portion of the show.\r\n\r\nOpen Circus: A place for expression and creativity. Bring your guitar, your drums, your voice, your words….comedy, drama, poetry, rock, world beat….bring yourself, and share whatever it is you’re best in sharing. We will be featuring a weekly artist or two to start us out and push us along, with a rotating crew of improvised comedy performers to keep us laughing all night….so come one come all, grab a seat, a coffee/beer, and a mic.\r\n\r\nJazz Happy Hour: This once a month happy hour / evening event features legendary Des Moines DJ Nighthawk, the alias of Urban Dreams founder and former Iowa House Representative Wayne Ford, spinning the best Jazz and R&amp;B for a discerning audience.",

Instructor James Serpento leads a course focusing on the craft of structuring story for maximum impact, drawing from his own experience and that of many theorists and practitioners (including Robert McKee, David Mamet, Michael Hauge and others). Includes lecture/discussion and writing exercises designed to move the writer toward creating the sort of powerful plays and films that hold audiences riveted.",

Come learn how with master brewers who will teach you the ins and outs of home-brewing, what equipment you will need and possibly share some of their greatest concoctions. This class is for an audience 21 and older.\r\n\r\nPop-up Restaurants: There are too many talented chefs in this town that don’t have their own joints. We’re gonna give them at least 1 night a month to showcase what they do best. Once a month we will feature a new chef and a new Pop-Up Restaurant. Keep your eyes peeled for announcements about this recurring series.\r\n\r\nGrow Your Own Salsa Garden: A hands-on class for both adults and children, designed to educate students about growing and caring for the ingredients found in salsa. At the end of the class, take home your own salsa!\r\n\r\nMolecular Smolecular: What do you get when you combine food, chemistry and art? Learn how to deconstruct any dish, change the look and feel of any ingredient, to impress dinner guests, and to take your taste buds on an adventure–also known as molecular gastronomy! Tapioca is not just for pudding anymore. Play with your food!\r\n\r\nNew Nine Wine: Here are 9 grapes you know: Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, White Zinfandel (not actually a grape), Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Pinot Noir. Boring! There are over 1,000,000 grapes – come learn about some not on your radar. Sure to please your palate and your pocketbook.\r\n\r\nFirst of the Spring Bloomers: Learn how to design and care for cool-season annuals for a gorgeous container display.\r\n\r\nFood Art: An annual celebration of all that is food and art, we pair chefs and visual artists together to create the ultimate (legal) hedonistic experience. Come see and taste the creations of our local maestros and vote on the one you love the most.\r\n\r\nCock Fighting: First, you take a rooster. Then you place your bet…just kidding – this is a cocktail competition. Local mixologists will square off in front of you, and you get to taste their concoctions. Each drink master will be given 3 ingredients unknown until the moment they see them, and then have to beat to clock to create the most delicious, original and boozy drink they can come up with.\r\n\r\nJazz Brunch: The best of New Orleans brought here to you. Stealing completely out of the French Quarter, come down on Sunday mornings and eat your creole while listening to soul. Swizzles and gumbo will be present.\r\n\r\nYour Mom’s Sauces: The Mother Sauces. You can’t cook without them. Learn how to make them: Béchamel, Espagnole, Hollandaise, Velouté and Classic Tomato. You think you know how to cook, but if you don’t know these 5, it’s amateur hour at your home.",

This class is for an audience 21 and older.\r\n\r\nPop-up Restaurants: There are too many talented chefs in this town that don’t have their own joints.

Then you place your bet…just kidding – this is a cocktail competition. Local mixologists will square off in front of you, and you get to taste their concoctions.

      "post_content": "Original to the Firehouse in 1937, this 850 sq. ft. space with 18 foot ceilings was a functioning handball court for the first 60 years of its life. The court later became an office space as the fire department struggled with space for their administrative staff. In preserving this historic building during our renovation, we have taken out the drop ceilings and false walls, cleaned the wood floors, and added a grid system for aerial acrobatic classes and hanging artwork to re-create the Handball Court as it was originally built with a little touch of our own.\r\n\r\nThe unique dimensions and natural reverb found in the Handball Court prompted us to reserve this room for our most eclectic programming. Dubbed the “Experimental Gallery,” this room will be home to groundbreaking work in all mediums, from large-scale visual installations to noise music concerts and everything in between.\r\n\r\n2014 Handball Court Events:\r\n\r\nEmerging Artist Pop-up Galleries:\r\nWorking in coordination with the main gallery on the first floor of the Headquarter Building, the Social Club will also provide alternative spaces for artists in a variety of mediums at a variety of points in their artistic careers to show their work. With working spaces including not only the Handball Court but also a 20 foot tall viaduct wall, high-ceilinged vestibules, and various walls around the campus, each space necessarily influences how the work is presented, furthering the Social Club’s mission to simultaneously provide space for emerging artists while also challenging them to respond to their surroundings.\r\n\r\nOccurrence: Quarterly, Beginning March 2014\r\n\r\nScreen It!

By juxtaposing genres, instrumentations, songwriting styles, and fan bases, this event will create a unique musical experience wholly dictated by the intersection between the two acts.\r\nOccurrence: Monthly, beginning spring 2014\r\n\r\nStory Mob:\r\nStory Mob is like a Flash Mob.

      "description": "Original to the Firehouse in 1937, this 850 sq. ft. space with 18 foot ceilings was a functioning handball court for the first 60 years of its life. The court later became an office space as the fire department struggled with space for their administrative staff. In preserving this historic building during our renovation, we have taken out the drop ceilings and false walls, cleaned the wood floors, and added a grid system for aerial acrobatic classes and hanging artwork to re-create the Handball Court as it was originally built with a little touch of our own.\r\n\r\nThe unique dimensions and natural reverb found in the Handball Court prompted us to reserve this room for our most eclectic programming. Dubbed the “Experimental Gallery,” this room will be home to groundbreaking work in all mediums, from large-scale visual installations to noise music concerts and everything in between.\r\n\r\n2014 Handball Court Events:\r\n\r\nEmerging Artist Pop-up Galleries:\r\nWorking in coordination with the main gallery on the first floor of the Headquarter Building, the Social Club will also provide alternative spaces for artists in a variety of mediums at a variety of points in their artistic careers to show their work. With working spaces including not only the Handball Court but also a 20 foot tall viaduct wall, high-ceilinged vestibules, and various walls around the campus, each space necessarily influences how the work is presented, furthering the Social Club’s mission to simultaneously provide space for emerging artists while also challenging them to respond to their surroundings.\r\n\r\nOccurrence: Quarterly, Beginning March 2014\r\n\r\nScreen It! Local Movie Showcase:\r\nIntimate screenings of films made by local filmmakers, including talkback / q&amp;a sessions when available.\r\nOccurrence: Quarterly, beginning fall 2014\r\n\r\nOpera Eight:\r\nOpera Eight is a performance-oriented group that hosts monthly salons – casual performances in which singers can try out new material, meet other singers, and enjoy the craft. Singers choose their repertoire based on each salon’s theme (past themes include villains, literature, revenge, body swap), and audience members participate in trivia contests based around that theme.\r\nOccurrence: Quarterly, beginning March 2014\r\n\r\nProjection Mapping:\r\nBoth local and national artists will introduce Des Moines to the growing new media art form of projection mapping, in which video projections interact with 3D objects to bring them to life.\r\nOccurrence: Quarterly, beginning summer 2014\r\n\r\nAerial Fabric Classes:\r\nWant to learn how to fly through the air? This class is a great way to try out all things aerial. From the trapeze, to the aerial hoop and aerial fabric, there’s no better way to have fun, get fit, and improve your coordination. No experience is necessary, simply a curiosity for all things aerial. Classes are individualized to your needs and strengths and will be led by Aerialist Felicia Coe.\r\nOccurrence: Weekly, begging spring 2014\r\n\r\nHandball Installations:\r\nWorking in a variety of mediums, both local and national artists will create site-specific installations in the Handball Court.\r\nOccurrence: Quarterly, beginning spring 2014\r\n\r\nSong Swap:\r\nTwo local bands / musicians are paired together for a unique show that features not only original sets from each artist, but a requirement that each act covers two of the other’s songs. By juxtaposing genres, instrumentations, songwriting styles, and fan bases, this event will create a unique musical experience wholly dictated by the intersection between the two acts.\r\nOccurrence: Monthly, beginning spring 2014\r\n\r\nStory Mob:\r\nStory Mob is like a Flash Mob. A mob of people gather, and a story breaks out. 5…minute stories 4…times per year 3…guest judges 2…cash prizes 1…story prop. The prop will serve as the story theme during the Open Mob (open mic) session.\r\nOccurrence: Quarterly, beginning February 2014\r\n\r\nAdult Circus:\r\nWant to learn amazing new skills and invigorate your fitness routine? Circus classes are the ideal addition to your fitness plan. Perfect for adults of all ages and fitness levels – beginners welcome.

Crucial to preserving this historic building was maintaining the size and openness of this room, so it became obvious to us that we needed a community partner to take this space and transform it into their own. This is where our friends at Orchestrate Hospitality (the brains behind Zombie Burger, Centro, and other amazing restaurants around town) stepped in to create their newest restaurant, MALO.\r\n\r\nMALO is Des Moines’ destination for Latin cuisine.

Crucial to preserving this historic building was maintaining the size and openness of this room, so it became obvious to us that we needed a community partner to take this space and transform it into their own. This is where our friends at Orchestrate Hospitality (the brains behind Zombie Burger, Centro, and other amazing restaurants around town) stepped in to create their newest restaurant, MALO.\r\n\r\nMALO is Des Moines’ destination for Latin cuisine. From classic Havana cocktails to inventive Mexican dishes, MALO celebrates all the flavors of Latin America.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://malodesmoines.com/\">http://malodesmoines.com</a>",

Committed to supporting artists and creating opportunities to enhance the art scene in Des Moines, the Viaduct Gallery connects the community with progressive and dynamic art of all mediums. The 1,800+ square foot space is located on the first floor of the Des Moines Social Club, adjacent to Capes Kafé and Malo Restaurant.\r\n\r\nThe Viaduct Gallery, led by Director Elise Goodmann, is curated by local artists Rachel Buse, Joe Crimmings, Benjamin Gardner, Jami Graves and Aaron Tinder.\r\n\r\nThe gallery is available to host special events and private functions. Contact rentals@desmoinessocialclub.org for more information.\r\n\r\nLearn more at <a href=\"http://desmoinessocialclub.org/viaduct-gallery/\">http://desmoinessocialclub.org/viaduct-gallery</a>.\r\n\r\nExhibitions\r\nInterface: March 14, 2014 – April 13, 2014\r\nGrand View Art &amp; Design Department’s Annual Student Competition: April 18, 2014 – May 11, 2014\r\nPedalArt Des Moines: May 16, 2014\r\n\r\nComing in 2014\r\nArtist Residency\r\nThe Artist Residency program at the Viaduct Gallery will provide artists with a chance to expand beyond just a gallery show. They’ll not only present; they’ll create, teach and reflect at the DMSC. Open to artists local and national/international levels, it creates space for artists to explore their work within a new community — fostering artistic growth personally and communally.\r\n\r\nInstagrammies\r\nRoll out the red carpet for those hoping to become Insta-famous during the inaugural Instagrammies! Anyone can submit photos, and our guest judges will pick the winners in a variety of categories, including: food, nature, cats, animals that aren’t cats, selfies (duh) and others. Prizes will also be awarded to the people’s choice winner.\r\n\r\nGallery Shows\r\nThis encompasses all of the art you will see in the DMSC’s Viaduct Gallery, including (but not limited to) call-for-entry shows, local showcases, group shows, site-specific installations, artist residencies and many more.\r\n\r\nCall-for-Entry Art Shows\r\nArtists will submit shows and ideas, and this ongoing process of incoming entries will be a vital component of the Viaduct Gallery. Additionally, we will host medium-specific, genre-specific and other specialized shows in the gallery.\r\n\r\nGroup Shows\r\nSeveral artists work together in a common theme, medium or other factor connecting the work to present a show in the Viaduct Gallery.",

Committed to supporting artists and creating opportunities to enhance the art scene in Des Moines, the Viaduct Gallery connects the community with progressive and dynamic art of all mediums. The 1,800+ square foot space is located on the first floor of the Des Moines Social Club, adjacent to Capes Kafé and Malo Restaurant.\r\n\r\nThe Viaduct Gallery, led by Director Elise Goodmann, is curated by local artists Rachel Buse, Joe Crimmings, Benjamin Gardner, Jami Graves and Aaron Tinder.\r\n\r\nThe gallery is available to host special events and private functions. Contact rentals@desmoinessocialclub.org for more information.\r\n\r\nLearn more at <a href=\"http://desmoinessocialclub.org/viaduct-gallery/\">http://desmoinessocialclub.org/viaduct-gallery</a>.\r\n\r\nExhibitions\r\nInterface: March 14, 2014 – April 13, 2014\r\nGrand View Art &amp; Design Department’s Annual Student Competition: April 18, 2014 – May 11, 2014\r\nPedalArt Des Moines: May 16, 2014\r\n\r\nComing in 2014\r\nArtist Residency\r\nThe Artist Residency program at the Viaduct Gallery will provide artists with a chance to expand beyond just a gallery show. They’ll not only present; they’ll create, teach and reflect at the DMSC. Open to artists local and national/international levels, it creates space for artists to explore their work within a new community — fostering artistic growth personally and communally.\r\n\r\nInstagrammies\r\nRoll out the red carpet for those hoping to become Insta-famous during the inaugural Instagrammies! Anyone can submit photos, and our guest judges will pick the winners in a variety of categories, including: food, nature, cats, animals that aren’t cats, selfies (duh) and others. Prizes will also be awarded to the people’s choice winner.\r\n\r\nGallery Shows\r\nThis encompasses all of the art you will see in the DMSC’s Viaduct Gallery, including (but not limited to) call-for-entry shows, local showcases, group shows, site-specific installations, artist residencies and many more.\r\n\r\nCall-for-Entry Art Shows\r\nArtists will submit shows and ideas, and this ongoing process of incoming entries will be a vital component of the Viaduct Gallery. Additionally, we will host medium-specific, genre-specific and other specialized shows in the gallery.\r\n\r\nGroup Shows\r\nSeveral artists work together in a common theme, medium or other factor connecting the work to present a show in the Viaduct Gallery.",
